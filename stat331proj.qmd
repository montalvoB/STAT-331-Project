```{r}
# import data sets
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)


happy <- read_csv("hapiscore_whr.csv")
income <- read_csv("mincpcap_cppp.csv")
```

-   Join the two datasets into one (long) dataset ...

    -   where each observation is a country / year

    -   There should be a column for each quantitative variable as well as the country and year

    -   You may need to do some additional data cleaning before joining (see below)

```{r}
## make long data set 
happy <- happy|>
  pivot_longer(cols = `2005`:`2023`,
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "happy_score")

income <- income|>
  pivot_longer(cols = `1800`:`2100`,
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "avg_daily_inc")
```

```{r}
## merge into one data set 
happy_income <- happy|>
  left_join(income, 
            by = c("year","country"))
```
